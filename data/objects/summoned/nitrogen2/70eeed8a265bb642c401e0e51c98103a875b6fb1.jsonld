The total production of manure N and P increased from 1.4 Tg N yr-1 and 0.3 Tg P yr-1 in 1860 to 7.4 Tg N yr-1 and 2.3 Tg P yr-1 in 2017. The increasing manure nutrient production was associated with increased livestock numbers before the 1980s and enhanced livestock weights after the 1980s. The high-nutrient region mainly enlarged from the Midwest toward the Southern U.S., and became more concentrated in numerous hot spots after the 1980s. The South Atlantic-Gulf and Mid-Atlantic basins were the two critical coastal regions with high environmental risks due to the enrichment of manure nutrient production and application from the 1970s to 2010s. Our long-term manure N and P datasets provide critical information for national and regional assessments of nutrient budgets and can also serve as the input data for ecosystem and hydrological models to examine biogeochemical cycles in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.","@reverse":{"isBasedOn":{"@id":"https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-515-2021","@type":["CreativeWork","PublicationIssue"],"identifier":"https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-515-2021","url":"https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-13-515-2021","creator":[{"@id":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2310-3662","@type":"Person","name":"Zihao Bian","familyName":"Bian","givenName":"Zihao","identifier":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2310-3662","email":"zzb0009@auburn.edu"},{"@id":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1806-4091","@type":"Person","name":"Hanqin Tian","familyName":"Tian","givenName":"Hanqin","identifier":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1806-4091","email":"tianhan@auburn.edu"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Qichun Yang","familyName":"Yang","givenName":"Qichun"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Rongting Xu","familyName":"Xu","givenName":"Rongting","email":"rongting.xu@oregonstate.edu"},{"@id":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7920-1427","@type":"Person","name":"Shufen Pan","familyName":"Pan","givenName":"Shufen","identifier":"https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7920-1427","email":"panshuf@auburn.edu"},{"@id":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8370-0509","@type":"Person","name":"Bowen Zhang","familyName":"Zhang","givenName":"Bowen","identifier":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8370-0509","email":"bzhang5@bsu.edu"}],"name":"Production and application of manure nitrogen and phosphorus in the United States since 1860","datePublished":"2021","issueNumber":"13(2)","pagination":"515-527","isPartOf":{"@type":"CreativeWorkSeries","name":"Earth System Science Data"}}},"size":{"@type":"QuantitativeValue","value":24.0,"unitText":"data points"},"variableMeasured":[{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"File content"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"File name"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"File name"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"File format"},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"File size","unitText":"kByte","subjectOf":{"@type":"DefinedTermSet","hasDefinedTerm":{"@id":"urn:obo:pato:term:0000117","@type":"DefinedTerm","identifier":"urn:obo:pato:term:0000117","name":"size","url":"http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PATO_0000117"}}},{"@type":"PropertyValue","name":"Uniform resource locator/link to file"}],"keywords":"Application; manure; nitrogen; nutrient; Phosphorus; Production","comment":"Data are in ascii-format at a spatial resolution of 30 arc-second.
