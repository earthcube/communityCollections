According to the GLiM, the Earth is covered by 64 % sediments (a third of which is carbonates), 13 % metamorphics, 7 % plutonics, and 6 % volcanics, and 10% are covered by water or ice. The high resolution of the GLiM allows observation of regional lithological distributions which often vary from the global average. The GLiM enables regional analysis of Earth surface processes at global scales.","size":{"@type":"QuantitativeValue","value":37.8,"unitText":"kBytes"},"license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","conditionsOfAccess":"unrestricted","isAccessibleForFree":true,"inLanguage":"en","distribution":{"@type":"DataDownload","encodingFormat":"application/zip","contentUrl":"https://doi.pangaea.de/10013/epic.39939.d001"}}
