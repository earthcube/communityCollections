However, a global overview and analysis of dissolved carbon in soil solutions, covering a wide range of vegetation types and climates, is lacking. We compiled a global database on annual average dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in soil solutions, including potential governing factors, with 762 entries from 351 different sites covering a range of climate zones, land cover types and soil classes. Using this database we develop regression models to calculate topsoil concentrations, and concentrations vs. depth in the subsoil at the global scale. For DIC, the lack of a  roportional globally distributed cover inhibits analysis on a global scale. For DOC, annual average concentrations range from 1.7 to 88.3 (median=25.27) mg C/L for topsoils (n=255) and from 0.42 to 372.1 (median=5.50) mg C/L for subsoils (n=285, excluding lab incubations). Highest topsoil values occur in forests of cooler, humid zones. In topsoils, multiple regression showed that precipitation is the most significant factor. Our global topsoil DOC model (R2=0.36) uses precipitation, soil class, climate zone and land cover type as model factors. Our global subsoil model describes DOC concentrations vs. depth for different USDA soil classes (overall R2=0.45). Highest subsoil DOC concentrations are calculated for Histosols.","@reverse":{"isBasedOn":{"@id":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-03290-0","@type":["CreativeWork","PublicationIssue"],"identifier":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-03290-0","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s42452-020-03290-0","creator":[{"@id":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1951-2255","@type":"Person","name":"Joep Langeveld","familyName":"Langeveld","givenName":"Joep","identifier":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1951-2255","email":"j.j.langeveld@uu.nl"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Alexander F Bouwman","familyName":"Bouwman","givenName":"Alexander F"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Wim Joost van Hoek","familyName":"van Hoek","givenName":"Wim Joost"},{"@type":"Person","name":"Lauriane Vilmin","familyName":"Vilmin","givenName":"Lauriane"},{"@id":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0104-8615","@type":"Person","name":"A H W Beusen","familyName":"Beusen","givenName":"A H W","identifier":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0104-8615"},{"@id":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7110-5470","@type":"Person","name":"José M Mogollón","familyName":"Mogollón","givenName":"José M","identifier":"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7110-5470","email":"Jose.Mogollon@awi.de"},{"@id":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3601-9072","@type":"Person","name":"Jack J Middelburg","familyName":"Middelburg","givenName":"Jack J","identifier":"https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3601-9072","email":"jmiddelburg@nioo.knaw.nl"}],"name":"Estimating dissolved carbon concentrations in global soils: a global database and model","datePublished":"2020","issueNumber":"2(10)","pagination":"1626","isPartOf":{"@type":"CreativeWorkSeries","name":"SN Applied Sciences"}}},"size":{"@type":"QuantitativeValue","value":7.8,"unitText":"MBytes"},"keywords":"Carbon leaching; database; DIC; dissolved carbon; DOC; global model; soil carbon; soil solution; vadose zone","comment":"This is the Supplementary Information (SI) in addition to the article 'Global database and model on dissolved carbon in soil solution' by Langeveld et al.\nBelow a brief overview of the SI content is given.
