With a satisfactory performance when validated against in situ GPP estimates, this dataset offers an alternative GPP estimates for regional to global carbon cycle studies.","citation":{"@id":"hdl:10013/epic.51475.d001","@type":["CreativeWork","WebPage"],"identifier":"hdl:10013/epic.51475.d001","url":"https://doi.pangaea.de/10013/epic.51475.d001","name":"Figure 4.
